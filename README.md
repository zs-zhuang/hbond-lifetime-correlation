# Summary

This repository contains a script that estimates hydrogen bond lifetime between water molecules (light blue) and cellulose surface (green) during a molecular dynamics simulation using correlation. Donor and receptor pairs were identified based on atom types and geometric criterion (angle and distance) at each time step (frame) over time. For candidate hydrogen bond pairs, the lifetime of the bond is estimated using correlation.
